# VR_MarketPlace

## Project Overview

VR_MarketPlace is a decentralized marketplace for VR assets built on the Internet Computer (ICP). It allows users to create, list, buy, and manage VR assets using blockchain technology, with secure authentication and a modern web frontend.

## Features

- User authentication via Internet Identity (ICP)
- Create and list new VR assets with name, description, price, and image
- Buy and sell VR assets (ownership transfer)
- List assets for sale and remove from sale
- Delete owned assets
- View all assets in grid or list view
- Sort assets by price (low-high, high-low) or newest
- Responsive and modern UI (React + Vite)
- Rust-based backend canister for asset management
- Secure principal-based ownership and transactions

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- Vite (build tool)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- Sass (styling)
- @dfinity/agent, @dfinity/auth-client, @dfinity/candid (ICP integration)
- Internet Identity for authentication
- Vitest, Testing Library (testing)

### Backend (Canister)
- Rust (main logic)
- ic-cdk, ic-cdk-macros (ICP smart contract SDK)
- Candid (IDL for canister interface)
- serde (serialization)

### DevOps & Tooling
- DFX (Internet Computer SDK)
- Node.js & npm (package management)
- Workspace monorepo structure

## How to Run

1. Install DFX, Node.js, and npm (see ICP docs)
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install` in the root and frontend folder
3. Start the local replica: `dfx start --clean`
4. Deploy canisters: `dfx deploy`
5. Start the frontend: `npm run start --workspace VR_MarketPlace_frontend`
6. Open the app at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown)

## Canister Interface (Candid)

See `src/VR_MarketPlace_backend/VR_MarketPlace_backend.did` for the full service interface, including:
- greet
- create_asset
- list_assets
- buy_asset
- list_for_sale
- delete_asset

Welcome to your new `VR_MarketPlace` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `VR_MarketPlace`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd VR_MarketPlace/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
